# Sprint project 01: Instructions
> E-Commerce Data Pipeline

For solving this project and creating the ELT pipeline you will need to complete Python (.py) and SQL (.sql) files distributed across different folders. Below we provide instructions on how to proceed and the order:

## 1. Extract

For the pipeline data extraction phase, you will have to fill in all the functions with a **TODO** mark inside the `src/extract.py` module.

If you want to check your code meets the requirements, you can test that particular module simply by running:

```console
$ pytest tests/test_extract.py
```

## 2. Load

Now you have all the data from different sources, it's time to store that in a Data Warehouse. We will use SQLite as our database engine to keep things simpler but, in larger companies, Snowflake is one of the most popular options for Data Warehouses these days.

Please, complete all the functions with a **TODO** mark inside the `src/load.py` module.

## 3. Transform

Having the data inside our Data Warehouse, we can start making queries and transformations.

For this task, we already provide you with the needed code inside `src/extract.py` module but, you will have to write the SQL queries 😬.

Please, complete all the `.sql` scripts with a **TODO** mark inside the `queries/` folder.

You can make use of other tools like DBeaver to write and test the queries in a more interactive way. Lastly, you can check your queries meets the requirements by running the provided tests with:

```console
$ pytest tests/test_transform.py
```

You can also validate how the output from the query should look like checking the `.json` file under `tests/query_results` with the same name as the `.sql` file.

## 4. Visualize your results

Finally, having all the results from our queries, it's time to start making some visualization for the presentation.

For this, you should open the `AnyoneAI - Sprint Project 01.ipynb` Jupyter notebook provided, fill in the **TODO** parts and ensure all the cells runs in the pre-defined order without issues.

## 5. [OPTIONAL] Data Orchestration with Apache Airflow

In this optional task, we ask you to re-use the current ELT pipeline code to create an Airflow DAG so we automatize the entire process.

Please don't modify or change the structure of the current project or code that can break the unit tests provided. Instead, we suggest you work on a new folder inside the project and put all the DAGs' code there. This is an open-ended task thus, it can have more than one right answer, solution, or outcome and can be completed in more than one way. If you have time and want to push the limits, go ahead!

## Project Structure

Before starting to work, let's take a deep overview of the project structure and each module inside:

```

Now let's look at the main components:

### dataset

It has all the .csvs with the information that will be used in the project.

- `dataset/olist_customers_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the location of the customers.
- `dataset/olist_order_items_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the shipping.
- `dataset/olist_order_payments_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the payment.
- `dataset/olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the clients' reviews.
- `dataset/olist_orders_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the different dates of each sale's process.
- `dataset/olist_products_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the details of each product.
- `dataset/olist_sellers_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the location of the sellers.
- `dataset/product_category_name_translation.csv`: csv with info regarding the translation of each category from Portuguese to English.

### queries

It contains all the SQL queries and the code you will need to complete, to later create tables and plots.

- `queries/delivery_date_difference.sql`: This query will return a table with two columns; State, and Delivery_Difference. The first one will have the letters that identify the states, and the second one the average difference between the estimated delivery date and the date when the items were actually delivered to the customer.
- `queries/global_ammount_order_status.sql`: This query will return a table with two columns; order_status, and Amount. The first one will have the different order status classes and the second one the total amount of each.
- `queries/real_vs_estimated_delivered_time.sql`: This query will return a table with the differences between the real and estimated delivery times by month and year. It will have different columns: month_no, with the month numbers going from 01 to 12; month, with the 3 first letters of each month (e.g. Jan, Feb); Year2016_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2016 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2017_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2017 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2018_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2018 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2016_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2016 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2017_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2017 (NaN if it doesn't exist) and Year2018_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2018 (NaN if it doesn't exist).
- `queries/revenue_by_month_year.sql`: This query will return a table with the revenue by month and year. It will have different columns: month_no, with the month numbers going from 01 to 12; month, with the 3 first letters of each month (e.g. Jan, Feb); Year2016, with the revenue per month of 2016 (0.00 if it doesn't exist); Year2017, with the revenue per month of 2017 (0.00 if it doesn't exist) and Year2018, with the revenue per month of 2018 (0.00 if it doesn't exist).
- `queries/revenue_per_state.sql`: This query will return a table with two columns; customer_state, and Revenue. The first one will have the letters that identify the top 10 states with the most revenue and the second one the total revenue of each.
- `queries/top_10_least_revenue_categories.sql`: This query will return a table with the top 10 least revenue categories in English, the number of orders, and their total revenue. The first column will be Category, which will contain the top 10 least revenue categories; the second one will be Num_order, with the total amount of orders of each category; and the last one will be Revenue, with the total revenue of each category.
- `queries/top_10_revenue_catgories.sql`: This query will return a table with the top 10 revenue categories in English, the number of orders, and their total revenue. The first column will be Category, which will contain the top 10 revenue categories; the second one will be Num_order, with the total amount of orders of each category; and the last one will be Revenue, with the total revenue of each category.
